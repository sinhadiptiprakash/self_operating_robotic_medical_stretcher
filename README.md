# Self Operating Robotic Medical Stretcher
Designed a medical stretcher that automatically detects the desires of movement of the patients and moves accordingly. The operations can be controlled by a simulation app and voice commands through a smartphone as well. Also designed a real-time IoT-based monitoring system for monitoring the status and conditions of the stretchers. Used Arduino and Arduino compatible various sensors, NodeMCU, Network modules, Bluetooth modules, servos, etc as hardware and Embedded C as a programming language. For this project, our team was honorary mentioned in NITCP'19.
